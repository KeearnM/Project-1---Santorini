## The Game

Santorini is a grid based game. Every round the players can first move then choose on either an empty grid or on top of an already built building. The game ends when a player either built a three level building and reached the top of it or when all opposing players are rendered immobile.


## Currently Implemented

Stages of the game:

Place function:

The first stage of the game where the user is prompted to place the character on the screen

Game stage:

Players can move once per round and build a building, in the current implementation of the game the only winning condition currently is surronding the opposing players and preventing them from moving
